# formalising_ach_mphil

This repository contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the simulations reported in the thesis: "Formalising the Adaptive Coding Hypothesis: A Plastic Attractor Explains Neuroimaging Task Codes and Their Perturbation by TMS".

To reproduce the results reported in:

- Simulations 1 and 2 run plasticattractor_centralscript.py which calls the functions plasticattractor_networksims, plasticattractor_behaviour, plasticattractor_behaviouralanalysis, and plasticattractor_decoding.

- Simulations 3 run plasticattractor_errors.py

- Appendix 1 run plasticattractor_biasedcompetition.py 

- Appendix 2 run plasticattractor_workingmemory.py
