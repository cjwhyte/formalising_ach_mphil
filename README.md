# formalising_ach_mphil

This repository contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the simulations reported in the thesis "Formalising the Adaptive Coding Hypothesis: 

A Plastic Attractor Explains Neuroimaging Task Codes and Their Perturbation by TMS" 

submitted for the degree Master of Philosophy to Trinity Hall, Univeristy of Cambridge. 

To reproduce the results reported in simulations 1 and 2 run:
plasticattractor_centralscript.py which calls the functions plasticattractor_networksims, plasticattractor_behaviour, plasticattractor_behaviouralanalysis, and plasticattractor_decoding.

To reproduce the results reported in simulations 3 run:
plasticattractor_errors.py

To reproduce the simulation reported in appendix 1 run:
Run plasticattractor_biasedcompetition.py 

To reproduce the simulation reported in appendix 2 run:
Run plasticattractor_workingmemory.py
